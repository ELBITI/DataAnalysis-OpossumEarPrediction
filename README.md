# DataAnalysis-OpossumEarPrediction
This project explores the development of a predictive model to estimate the ear size (ear conch) of opossums based on their footprint size (footlength). Using a robust dataset and advanced data science techniques, we aim to assist researchers in identifying specific opossum traits in the wild.
